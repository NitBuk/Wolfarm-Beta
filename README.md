# Wolfram-Beta ðŸŽ¯ ðŸ§® ðŸ§°
# Description

- Wolfram-Beta is a comprehensive application designed to provide calculations across multiple areas of mathematics.
- The calculator includes support for Linear Algebra, Calculus, Number Theory, Statistics, Probability, Trigonometry, and Logarithms.
- It operates through an interactive text-based menu, allowing users to select the type of mathematics they are interested in, and then providing various operations related to that field.
- Please note that this project is currently in its early stages and is far from finished. Many files require additional work and the functionality is continually being expanded. Contributions are welcome!

# Files Included

The following python files are included in the project:

- main.py - The main script that runs the calculator
- test.py - Contains the test suite for the calculator
- linear_algebra.py & linear_api.py - Linear algebra operations and their API functions
- calculus.py & calculus_api.py - Calculus operations and their API functions
- number_theory.py & number_api.py - Number theory operations and their API functions
- statistics_and_probability.py & statistics_api.py - Statistics and Probability operations and their API functions
- trigo_and_log.py & trigo_api.py - Trigonometry and logarithm operations and their API functions

# Getting Started

# Dependencies
- This project requires Python 3.8 or later. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- The project also depends on the following Python packages:
numpy
sympy
matplotlib
math
statistics

# Installing
- You can install these packages using pip:

pip install numpy sympy matplotlib math statistics

- To install the project, first, you need to clone the repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and run the following command:

git clone https://github.com/NitBuk/Wolfram-Beta.git

- After cloning the repository, navigate to the project's root directory and install the required packages using pip.

# Executing program
- After successfully cloning the project and installing the dependencies, navigate to the root directory of the project in the terminal. You can start the calculator by running the main.py script with the following command:

python main.py

- The program will provide a menu of options, each corresponding to a different mathematical field. Enter the number of your choice to proceed.

# Running the tests
- The calculator is also equipped with a test suite to ensure its operations are functioning correctly. You can run the tests by selecting option -1 from the main menu. This will initiate the test suite and display the results.

# Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community. If you'd like to contribute, you can fork the repository, make your changes, and then submit a pull request. Pull requests are welcome for bug fixes, feature additions, and improvements.

For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. This helps us to coordinate our work and avoid duplicating effort or conflicting changes.
